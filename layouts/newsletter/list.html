  <h1>Newsletter</h1>
  <p>
    I occasionally send out a newsletter with personal stories, things I’ve been
    working on in the past month, and interesting things I come across.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's no fixed frequency, but generally don't expect more than one email
    per month. Consider it an adventure for both of us!

    You can also subscribe via <a href="/newsletter/index.xml">RSS</a>. The feed
    generally gets updated within a week of sending the newsletter.
