title: JavaScript Framework Diet
description: |
  JavaScript frameworks are great, but overused. Adding small bits of interactivity to an interface shouldn't mean installing kilobytes of dependencies or introducing complex build tools.

  It's time for a diet. I'm challenging you to build something without a framework, or follow along and learn something along the way.

  Series under development, posts are added on a weekly basis.
