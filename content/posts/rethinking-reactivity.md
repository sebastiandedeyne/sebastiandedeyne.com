As I roam deeper into Svelte territory, I came across [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyFI-zOrKSk) from 2019 by [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris), creator of Svelte.

Rich explains how he arrived at Svelte's reactivity from first principles, swimming against the virtual-DOM stream other frameworks follow.

Despite being from 2019, it's still relevant. Even if you're not into Svelte, it's worth watching as a great standalone talk.
