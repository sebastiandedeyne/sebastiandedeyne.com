I recently attended the inaugural edition of Full Stack Europe. What a lovely conference it was! I had a great time watching the talks and talking with other attendees, and came home with a lot of food for thought. Here are a few tweet-sized reviews of my favorite talks.

The talks were recorded but aren't available yet. I'll update this post with video links when they are.

## Caleb Porzio: Write Less JS

Caleb coined the term "server fetched partials" (fetching HTML from the server through AJAX like Turbolinks / PJAX). Caleb made a compelling case for writing less JS to reduce our stack's complexity and make it easier to test things.

## Bram Van Damme: JavaScript Yellow (lightning talk)

I've seen this talk twice already, but as part of his full-length ESNext proposals talk at meetups. However, as a lightning talk it had more impact. To condense the talk in a single sentence: don't use hammers for screws. It taught me about the [rule of least power](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/the-rule-of-least-power/).

## Konstantin Kudryashov: You might not need __

A deep talk about deferring responsibility towards off-the-shelf solutions to make the stack smaller. Solutions are only as valuable as their effectiveness in solving a real problem. Full stack developers shouldn't become better, they should make their stacks smaller.

## Sara Soueidan: Applied Accessibility: Practical Tips for Building More Accessible Front-Ends

Sara shared a massive amount of accessibility knowledge condensed in a 40 minute talk.

## Mattias Geniar: Debugging php,ruby,anything as a Linux sysadmin

A few cool Linux tricks to debug server issues. `strace` looks super interesting, going to have to remember that one. Check out his [article](https://ma.ttias.be/linux-application-script-debugging-with-strace/) on the same topic to get going.

## Jeremy Keith: Building

A beautiful parallel between the web, buildings and [pace layers](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand). After this talk, I left the building with a newfound love for what the web is.
