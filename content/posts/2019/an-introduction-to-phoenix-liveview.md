The last year or two, I've been playing around with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org). Chris McCord, author of the [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) web framework, is working on a new feature for Phoenix: LiveView.

> Phoenix LiveView is an exciting new library which enables rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML. LiveView powered applications are stateful on the server with bidrectional communication via WebSockets, offering a vastly simplified programming model compared to JavaScript alternatives.

In short, LiveView enables you to enable interactive, real-time app, without touching any JavaScript, as the application logic lives on the server.

LiveView looks like an interesting alternative to the current SPA trend. You can read Chris' entire walkthrough on [dockyard.com](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript). Even if you're not familiar with Elixir yet, LiveView's proposed programming model is an interesting topic on it's own.
