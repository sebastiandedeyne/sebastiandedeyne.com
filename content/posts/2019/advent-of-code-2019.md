It's that time of the year, for the Advent of Code, <br>
and this time around, I'm solving puzzles with Node.

My prior attempts included Elixir and TypeScript, <br>
but after a few days of tinkering, most challenges got skipped.

I'm going back to basics, this time to sharpen my blades, <br>
by solving all given puzzles without libraries to aid.

Feel free to join in, we've only just begun! <br>
