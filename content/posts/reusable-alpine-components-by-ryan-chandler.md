I've been more Alpine lately. Ryan has written a lot of [good stuff](https://ryangjchandler.co.uk/posts?category=alpinejs) on Alpine, but his reusable components post is what really got me kickstarted.

> You should be careful to not abstract too early. If you are finding it difficult to manage your Alpine component from the `x-data` attribute, this one is definitely for you.

The way this article builds up was very helpful: only use the level of abstraction you need:

1. No abstractions
2. Extract to a component function
3. Use `x-spread`
4. Mix in other data
