From [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/20113):

> Your app should work in a read-only mode without JavaScript.
> Without JavaScript I should still be able to read my email in Gmail, even if you donâ€™t let me compose, reply, or organise my messages.

I like this take on progressive enhancement. JavaScript is the language for interactivity on the web. Reading does not require two-way communication.
