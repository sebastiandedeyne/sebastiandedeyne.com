Timeless advice from [Derrick Reimer](https://www.derrickreimer.com/):

> Not all projects are inherently small, but you can always break them down into smaller chunks. […]
>
> Each incremental task brought us one step closer to a functioning v1. By shipping these tiny branches to production as we go, we became increasingly confident in the “bones” of the feature. As soon as a slice of the project was ready to test, the whole team hammered on it in production – an effective way to tease out bugs and rough spots in the user experience.
