I started using a hyper key on macOS. A hyper key is a single key mapped to <kbd>Shift + Ctrl + Opt + Cmd</kbd>. Since this isn't exactly practical to pull off with your fingers, apps don't use this combination for built-in shortcuts. This means you have a layer for custom shortcuts without worrying about clashes.

My hyper key is mapped to <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>. I actually already use caps lock as an escape key. Less travel than reaching for <kbd>Esc</kbd> with your pinky! Thanks to [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) and [Brett Terpstra's guide](https://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/) I was able to remap it as <kbd>Esc</kbd> _and_ a hyper key.

When I give <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> a short tap, it functions as <kbd>Esc</kbd>. If I hold it and press another key, it functions as a hyper key, <kbd>Shift + Ctrl + Opt + Cmd</kbd>.

I still have a lot of room to map to, but for now I'm using my hyper key for a few global application shortcuts like [Quick Entry in Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2249437/). In the future, I'm planning to map more [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) commands too.
