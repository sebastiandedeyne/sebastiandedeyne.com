As a short follow-up to [Everyone has JavaScript, right?](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/everyone-has-javascript-right), there's more to JavaScript than availability, there are also the performance implications.

I believe we're reaching for JavaScript more often because of its ecosystem, not because it's the better solution. The JavaScript ecosystem simply has incredible tools to build interfaces, and I hope server side solutions will still be able to compete.

I don't have a conclusion ready, I'm just interested in the topic. To be explored in 2019. Meanwhile, read [Chris Ferdinandi's thoughts on the matter](https://gomakethings.com/not-all-code-is-the-same/).
