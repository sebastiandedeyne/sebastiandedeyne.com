Nat Eliason on ideas and fermented jalapeÃ±os:

> **Good ideas require boredom.** If you constantly ingest new information, the existing information can never be digested.

Coming up with ideas is a passive undertaking, not an active one. You can't summon good ideas like a genie. They sneak up on you when your mind has enough space to wander.
