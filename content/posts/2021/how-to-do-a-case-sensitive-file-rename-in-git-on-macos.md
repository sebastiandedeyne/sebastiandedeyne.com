Mac is case insensitive, Linux isn't. This has caused me trouble in the past after deploying my code to an Ubuntu server.

If you rename a file on Mac, git won't pick up any changes if you only change the case.

<!--more-->

```bash
mv app.js App.js
```

macOS displays the newly-cased filename, but git doesn't see any changes.

In the past I've worked around this by doing two commits: one to change it to a different filename entirely, and then another to what it should be. `app.js` ‚Üí `appp.js` ‚Üí `App.js` ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Turns out there's an easier way: `git mv`. If you use the `git mv` command to rename the file, git picks it up correctly.

```bash
git mv app.js App.js
```

That's it. Happy committing!
