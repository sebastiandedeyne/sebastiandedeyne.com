I created the original Spatie guidelines site three years ago. Last month, we consolidated a few of our subsites to our main spatie.be site, including the [guidelines](https://spatie.be/guidelines).

Freek wrote a fresh introduction, and a few team members took some time to re-review the Laravel and JavaScript guidelines before relaunching.

> We consider our guidelines as a living document. People, teams, and opinions change over time. We don't dogmatically keep following rules we agreed on in the past, but keep challenging them. New experiences lead to new and improved guidelines.

We also used the old site for internal (private) guidelines. One of those was [security](https://spatie.be/guidelines/security), which is now publicly available. Another was our server setup guide, which I've turned into a [checklist](https://github.com/spatie/checklist-server-setup) in a separate GitHub repository.

You can read our guidelines on [spatie.be](https://spatie.be/guidelines). The old one's still available on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170820160203if_/https://guidelines.spatie.be/) for some nostaliga.
