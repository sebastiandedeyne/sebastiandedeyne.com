I'm trying something new (well, old): Sublime Text. Sublime was my favourite editor for years. It took me a while to not crave Sublime's speed in VS Code, but Code's intelligence and extension ecosystem makes it a worthy competitor.

Sublime has a *feel* that no other editor has. Scrolling, jumping, and typing are seamless. It's an analog tool in an Electron infested world. I miss that experience, so I'm giving it another go.

I already miss Code's intelligence, especially with TypeScript, but Sublime feels like coming home. Time will tell if it will last.
