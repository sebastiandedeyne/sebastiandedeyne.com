"Why Do We Interface?" is a micro-book about interfaces over the ages: from cave paintings to Google Glass to your latest note-taking app. It's important to understand _why_ we build interfaces in order to get better at building them.

> The purpose of any interface, regardless of the technology, is to retrieve, decode, modify, and/or distribute information. [â€¦]
>
> The core purpose of graphics in a GUI is not to be pretty
The purpose is to be informative.

Some questions to ask yourself when you're designing an interface:

> 1. How does the interface help us retrieve information?
> 2. Is it easy to decode the information that was retrieved?
> 3. Does the interface allow for easy and clear modification of information?
> 4. Does the interface assist in, and clearly declare when it is going to distribute information?
> 5. How will this interface redefine what it means to be human?

Number five is a bit too bold for my taste, but the first four are valuable guidelines.
