  <p>As the year comes to an end it's time to focus on finishing things.</p>
  <h2>Writing</h2>
  <p>I've got about 4 more posts to go to for my <a href="/javascript-framework-diet">JavaScript Framework Diet</a> series. I might expand later on, but when those are done I can finally consider the v1 of the series as "done".</p>
  <h2>Growing the Stack</h2>
  <p>I'm consistently sending out my <a href="https://growingthestack.io">Growing the Stack</a> newsletter every two weeks. I'm pretty excited about the content, but I need to spend more time promoting it.</p>
  <h2>Roam</h2>
  <p>I'm very much into <a href="https://roamresearch.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferer">Roam</a> these days. This could be the topic of a future blog series. I'm also working on an OSS static site generator based on Roam's references called <a href="http://github.com/spatie/intertwine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferer">Intertwine</a>. Although I'm not sure if it's worth persuing yet.</p>
