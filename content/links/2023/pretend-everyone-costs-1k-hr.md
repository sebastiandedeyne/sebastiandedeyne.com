Caleb Porzio released [this podcast episode](https://notesonwork.transistor.fm/episodes/pretend-everyone-costs-1k-hr) earlier this year, but it's been simmering in my head ever since.

The gist is to take things as far as you can before asking others. Instead of opening an issue, open a PR. Instead of replying "I don't know", find out. Before asking a question, write down the problem to make sure you've considered evey angle yourself.

Dealing with interactions this way gets things done more effectively, gives you the opportunity to learn something, and turns you into a nice person.
