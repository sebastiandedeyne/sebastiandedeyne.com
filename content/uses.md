## Development

My current IDE of choice is **PhpStorm**. I've been predominantly writing PHP  you can't beat PhpStorm when it comes to navigating and refactoring a large codebase.

Taking autocompletion and other IDE features out of the picture, **Sublime Text** is still my favorite editor. Its snappiness and multi-cursor options make it feel very natural, and it supports anything you throw at it regardless of format or size. I use a GitHub light theme in both editors.

## Productivity

My main browser is **Safari**. I value its low footprint and sync with my other devices, despite being the weakest of the bunch when it comes to devtools. When I occasionally need more advanced tooling, I switch to Chrome.

I use **Things** to manage tasks that are time-sensitive or need a reminder. I tend to store more information in note-taking apps. **iA Writer** has always been a staple and I'm currently experimenting with **Roam**.

I also want to mention **Excalidraw**. I do a lot of UX & product design work, and Excalidraw has been my tool of choice to mock up interfaces or create diagrams to clarify specs & documentation.

## Reading, learning, and leisure

On my Mac & phone I use **Reeder**. It's one of those Mac apps that has craft oozing out of it. It's tied to my **Instapaper** & **Feedbin** accounts. I use Feedbin over a free RSS aggregator because it has great email integration for newsletters. Instapaper is my read it later tool of choice because of its **Kindle** integration, where I do most reading.

I store bookmarks in **Pinboard**. It's a fast, simple product that has just the amount of features I need. Another daily driver is **Tweetbot** which I use on my Mac & phone to browse Twitter.
