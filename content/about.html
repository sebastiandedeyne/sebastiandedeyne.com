<section class="markup">
  <p>I'm a designer and full-stack developer from Ghent, Belgium.</p>
  <p>Besides programming, I like to be part of the design process of a website or product. Next to UI design I've been more and more invested in UX and project management lately.</p>
  <p>I write and share links about programming, JavaScript, Inertia.js, Laravel, and more. Here's a selection of my favorite posts over the years:</p>
