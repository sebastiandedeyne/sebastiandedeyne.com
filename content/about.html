  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm a web developer and designer from the charming city of Ghent, Belgium, and work at a big little company in Antwerp called <a href="https://spatie.be">Spatie</a>.</p>
  <p>My higher education was backend heavy. After obtaining my college degree in 2015, I started out as a PHP developer at Spatie. At the other end of the spectrum, client side frameworks always looked interesting to me. We started to experiment with Vue and React at work during their steady rise in popularity, and I was able to slowly pivot towards near full-time frontend development.</p>
  <p>Besides programming, I like to be part of the design process of a website or product. Next to UI design I've been more and more invested in UX and project management lately.</p>
  <p>If you want to get in touch to chat about programming, design, or anything else meaningful or meaningless, you can send me an <a href="mailto:sebastiandedeyne@gmail.com">email</a> or send me a DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/sebdedeyne">Twitter</a>.</p>
