I'm a designer and full-stack developer from Belgium. I work at [Spatie](https://spatie.be), a small but mighty web agency in Antwerp. We specialize in Laravel development, and have released a lot of open source packages.

Over the years, I've floated between backend development, frontend development, design, and product/project management.

## Colophon

This blog is generated with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. Plain old vanilla CSS and zero JavaScript, except for some privacy friendly analytics with [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/). Fonts are Karla and Berkeley Mono. I wrote some notes on the most recent design [here](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/2022-redesign).
