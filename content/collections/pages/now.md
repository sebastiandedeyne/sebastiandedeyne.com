*Last updated 2023-11-17. [What's this?](https://sive.rs/nowff)*

Now, I'm growing even more fond of having this blog. As I'm gradually losing interest in social media I enjoy sharing and writing here more than ever.

I haven't had much time to invest in open source the past few years. A large backlog of ideas has accumulated, and I've started to work through it.

I'm still learning Svelte. It's become my default frontend framework for side projects, and I enjoy talking and writing about it.

In my free time, I'm learning photography.
