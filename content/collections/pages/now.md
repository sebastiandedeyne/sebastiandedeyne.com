*Last updated 2023-06-26. [What's this?](https://sive.rs/nowff)*

Now, I'm learning Svelte. I'm using it for side projects, and recently for a small project at work for the first time.

I'm investing more time in frontend in general & design, after doing primarily backend for the past three years.

At the same time, my appreciation for event sourcing has only grown and I'm looking forward to writing more content around it.

In my free time, I'm learning photography.
