*Last updated 2024-08-06. [What's this?](https://sive.rs/nowff)*

Now, I'm trying to write more and better. In general—not necessarily here—inspired by Peter Suhm's excellent [Writing Habit](https://writinghabit.com) essay.

In programming, I'm simultaneously moving in two different directions. I've rediscovered the joy of frontend development, building things with React, Tailwind, Svelte… On the other hand, I'm exploring DDD concepts and modelling techniques like event storming.

In my free time, I'm learning photography.
