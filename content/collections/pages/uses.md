## Development

My current IDE of choice is [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/). I've been predominantly writing PHP  you can't beat PhpStorm when it comes to navigating and refactoring a large codebase.

Taking autocompletion and other IDE features out of the picture, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is still my favorite editor. Its snappiness and multi-cursor options make it feel very natural, and it supports anything you throw at it regardless of format or size. I use a GitHub light theme in both editors.

## Productivity

My main browser is **Safari**. I value its low footprint and sync with my other devices, despite being the weakest of the bunch when it comes to devtools. When I occasionally need more advanced tooling, I switch to Chrome.

I use [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) to manage tasks that are time-sensitive or need a reminder. I tend to store more information in note-taking apps. [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) has always been a staple for writing and I've recently started using [Obsidian](https://obisdian.md) for note-taking.

I also want to mention [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com). I do a lot of UX & product design work, and Excalidraw has been my tool of choice to mock up interfaces or create diagrams to clarify specs & documentation.
