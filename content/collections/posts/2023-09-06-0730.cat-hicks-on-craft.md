I lovely read on craft by Cat Hicks.

> Grandpa loved _craft_. […] He fixed things often and silently. Grandpa just cared about things working. He had an instinct for not just broken things but soon to be broken things. He would point out risky work, bad decision making in the form of shoddy materials or shifting angles.

As software developers, we often consider our trade to be unique. But what we (should) have in common with others is the mindset of respecting our craft—of producing solid and lasting work.

> I have read a lot of long spiels about craft that frequently end in something like, _software work isn’t like other work, and we shouldn’t be judged the same way. We are entirely unique. We are the special ones._ I find this both saddening and unconvincing. I think that all labor is skilled labor. I think about the factories and the fields and the ways that demands for speed instead of cadence can hurt people. I think we should seek to understand and value our skills and see effort. But I don’t think we are going to fix anything about how software work is valued by refusing to let it belong to the rest of the world.
