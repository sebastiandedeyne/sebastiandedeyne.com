I  want to talk about something I've been chewing on for a while: the monetization trap.

<!--more-->

Last year, I had a hard time writing a post, sending a newsletter, or researching a topic without considering if it could be part of some grand monetization scheme. Everyone and their dog seemed to have a project that generates passive income; I want a slice too!

Once you start to look at a project through the lens of monetization, the scope blows up. There are practical considerations like pricing and payment infrastructure, but more importantly, accountability towards people paying you. If I start a paid newsletter, I need out enough quality content to give people their money's worth. Out the door with the writing on a whenever-inspiration-strikes schedule.

The scope blows up before I even get started, and I'm paralyzed from doing anything.

I zoomed out and looked at the grand scheme of things. Why do I write? Why do I code in my spare time? People that bake cakes or tend to their garden aren't looking to monetize their hobbyâ€“the hobby itself is fulfilling. Writing and coding are my creative outlets. I already have a great job. Monetizing a side project wouldn't affect my life and finances in a significant way, at least not enough to warrant the time and stress.

After reflection, I realized I don't care about monetization as much as I thought, I got tricked into thinking I did because I see so many people around me building SaaS or selling paid memberships on the side. Does that mean I'll never monetize anything I do? Not necessarily, but I feel calmer realizing there's no hurry, and I don't need to shoehorn anything.
