[John Drexler](https://twitter.com/johnrudolphdrex) shares an easy to implement prioritization scheme when working with a client.

> It's a gift when another team gives you a wishlist of product improvements. Ask them to put their lists in order of importance, and then focus the conversation just on the top 5. This saves you loads of time. But it also brings them into the prioritization discussion and gets them to think like Product Managers too.
