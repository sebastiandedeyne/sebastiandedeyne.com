summary: "Here's a quick trick with the `:only-child` selector to display an empty state in a list."

On Twitter I came across a [great tip](https://twitter.com/clarkware/status/1705263936491356325?s=20) on displaying empty states with CSS.

When you're rendering a list, I often wrap a loop in an if/else statement to display an empty state when the list is empty.

{.short}
```blade
<section>
	@if($events->isNotEmpty())
	    @foreach($events as $event)
	        <article>
	            {{ $event->name }}
	        </article>
	    @endforeach
	@else
		<p>No events created yet!</p>
	@endif
</section>
```

If you want to reduce nesting and drop the conditional, here's a smart trick with the `:only-child` selector to display the message when there are no events.

{.short}
```blade
<section>
    @foreach($events as $event)
        <article>
            {{ $event->name }}
        </article>
    @endforeach
	<p>
	    No events created yet!
    </p>
</section>
```

{.short}
```css
section > p {
  display: none;
}

section > p:only-child {
  display: block;
}
```

We hide the message, but when it's the only child in the `section`, we'll display it. Since there are no other children, we know there are no events.

## Using Tailwind

Using Tailwind, we can use the `only:` variant to do the same.

{.short}
```blade
<section>
    @foreach($events as $event)
        <article>
            {{ $event->name }}
        </article>
    @endforeach
	<p class="hidden only:block">
	    No events created yet!
    </p>
</section>
```

PS: Extra goodie for Laravel devs: another way to do this is with the lesser-known `@forelse` Blade directive.

{.short}
```blade
<section>
    @forelse($events as $event)
        <article>
            {{ $event->name }}
        </article>
    @empty
		<p class="hidden only:block">
		    No events created yet!
	    </p>
	@endforelse
</section>
```
