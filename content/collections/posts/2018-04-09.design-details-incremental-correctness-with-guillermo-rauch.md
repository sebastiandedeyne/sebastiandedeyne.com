In a recent [Design Details](https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details) podcast, Guillermo Rauch ([@rauchg](https://twitter.com/rauchg)) shares his thoughts on the web, design, the value of code, type systems, cryptocurrencies and much much more.

I have a lot of respect for Guillermo's philosophies, and what he's building with [Zeit](https://zeit.co). An early quote from the interview (paraphrased):

> I've always had this passion for the hyperlink. My whole thesis is everything that has not yet been hyperlinked, will be hyperlinked. If we step back and take that thesis a little furtherâ€”you look at GitHub and they but a hyperlink on everything. They put a hyperlink on every per-character diff of your codebase. Every line of code. Every changeset. Everything.
