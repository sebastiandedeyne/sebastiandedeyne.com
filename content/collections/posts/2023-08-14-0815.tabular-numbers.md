One of my favorite underrated (and underused!) CSS properties is `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.

Tabular numbers are monospaced, which keeps their sizes consistent and keeps numbers with the same amount of digits aligned.

There are two common cases that warrant tabular numbers: tabular data and moving numbers.

## Tabular data

I suppose it's in the name. Numbers (especially large numbers) are easier to scan when they're tabular.

## Moving numbers

When numbers are updated in place (like a timer), tabular numbers keep them in place.

PS: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` is available as `.tabular-nums` in Tailwind.
