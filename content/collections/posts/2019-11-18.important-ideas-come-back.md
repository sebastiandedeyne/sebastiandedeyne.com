Long overdue, but I finished reading [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup). This quote stood out as I've experienced its effect first-hand.

> It’s easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They come up all the time and accumulate into big piles.
>
> Really important ideas will come back to you. When's the last time you forgot a really great, inspiring idea? And if it's not that interesting—maybe a bug that customers are running into from time to time—it'll come back to your attention when a customer complains again or a new customer hits it. If you hear it once and never again, maybe it wasn’t really a problem.

I used to keep lists for everything little thing that popped up. Both things that I _had_ to do and things that I _wanted_ to do. These lists slowly became mountains of work with paralyzing gazes, having the opposite effect of motivating me.

At some point I decided to delete all the baggage I'd been carrying around. It was exhilarating!

Now I only add things to a todo list that I'm not allowed to forget, not things that I have to or want to do. Something that's on a list for more than a week is a smell; maybe it's not as important as I thought.
