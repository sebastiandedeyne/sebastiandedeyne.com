Last week I was installing a mocking framework with Composer and got the following prompt:

```txt
$ composer require mockery/mockery
mockery/mockery is currently present in the require-dev key and you ran the command without the --dev flag, which will move it to the require key.
Do you want to move this requirement? [no]?
```

How cool! I didn't know you could hint Composer to suggest a dependency to be installed as a testing dependency.

After further inspection, Composer determines this based on the tags used for the package

If you add `dev`, `testing`, or `static analysis` keywords to your package's `composer.json`,  Composer will prompt users to install it as a dev dependency.
