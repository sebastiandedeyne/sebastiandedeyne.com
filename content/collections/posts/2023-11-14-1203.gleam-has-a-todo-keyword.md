[Gleam](https://gleam.run) is a statically typed language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. From distance, it looks like a love child of Go and Elixir (count me in!)

One neat language feature is a `todo` keyword. First-class syntax to mark a piece of code as _work in progress_, and to stop the compiler from yelling at your half-implemented code.

```gleam
fn favourite_number() -> Int {
  // The type annotations says this returns an Int, but we don't need
  // to implement it yet.
  todo
}

pub fn main() {
  favourite_number() * 2
}
```
