A lesser-known piece of Markdown syntax (and HTML) are description lists. Description lists are great for small bits of "key-value"-like information.

<!--more-->

{.short}
```md
This is an title
: This is a description
This is another title
: This is another description
```

Description lists are great for lists where you want to write more than just a bullet, like my [Reads](/reads) page.

Description lists aren't part of the Markdown or CommonMark spec, but are widely supported (by the `league/commonmark` PHP package and iA Writer, which are the places I write most.)
