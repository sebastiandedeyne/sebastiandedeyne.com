New iPads last week. OLED, Finally! Be it a high-resolution monitor with deep blacks or e-ink, screens the most important part of a piece of tech for me. Screens are what we're viewing the world through with these devices. I want a new iPad for it, but I can't get myself to need one.

I'm running a 2018 iPad Pro, the first that dropped the home button and came with a lush 120Hz refresh rate. Heck, it still has an Intel chip. Incredible how it still feels like a device from the future even without an M chip, while working on an Intel-based MacBook is a kick back to the dark ages.

I love my iPad. It's a great device for consuming content of all shapes and sizes. I could probably get a lot of work done on it if I decided to invest in itâ€”just no coding. I use it daily, the size and weight makes easy to throw it around the house with the lightweight Smart Keyboard Folio (my only gripe with last week's upgrade is they discontinued it). Fatih Arslan makes some good points in his [hymn for the iPad](https://arslan.io/2024/05/11/why-i-prefer-the-ipad-over-a-macbook/).

I'm looking forward to the day I'll have a thin, futuristic slice of OLED in my hands. But for now, my 6 year old iPad is just too good.
