Last week, we launched a redesigned for [Flare](https://flareapp.io), our Laravel error tracker.

I contributed to the app UI, but most of the work was done by [Digital With You](https://digitalwithyou.com), who provided us with the design, and the team that implemented it: [Alex](https://alexvanderbist.com), [Freek](https://freek.dev), [Rias](https://rias.be), [Ruben](https://rubenvanassche.com), and [Sam](https://www.sams.land).
