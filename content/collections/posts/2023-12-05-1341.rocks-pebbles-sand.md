A product management mindset from Jason Cohen.

> If you do little things first, there’s no time for big things.
> If do big things first, then you can fill in the smaller things.

And:

> It’s not important that every sprint is perfectly balanced between all types of work. It _is_ important that we’re balanced over a period several months, otherwise something important is getting starved. Indeed, it’s often wise to build imbalanced sprints intentionally, because that means greater focus, less context-switching, and therefore getting more quality work done.
