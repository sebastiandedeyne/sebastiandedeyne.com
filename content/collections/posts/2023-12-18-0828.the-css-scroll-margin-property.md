Last week I remembered the `scroll-margin` property existed.

<!--more-->

I was adding anchors to the headings of a page so visitors can directly link to a section. However, when that link was visited, the heading was glued against the top of the viewport. I prefer some margin between the browser chrome and the text to let it breath.

There's a CSS property for that: `scroll-margin`. It does nothing in most cases, but when you visit a URL that points to an anchor on the page, it will offset the element from the viewport.

{.short}
```css
h2 {
  scroll-margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

You can read all about `scroll-margin` in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin).
