I've been a Mac user for over a decade now. Over time I've added more and more Unix commands to my muscle memory.

List a directory? `ls`. Create a new file? `touch`.

But there are also pesky tasks that come up once in a blue moon.

List a directory in a single column to copy paste? `ls -whoknows`. Find all `jpeg` files in a subdirectory? `find -wtf -exec -idk \;`.

These mostly ends up in a needlessly long hunt for solutions between fifty StackOverflow posts and HTML documents that haven't been touched since the eighties.

This series is an attempt to document the Unix commands I know, and the ones I occasionally need. Follow along, and you might learn some tricks along the way! Consider this series a living document that will grow organically; I won't be updating or adding new posts on a set schedule.
