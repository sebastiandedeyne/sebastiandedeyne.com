Today I tagged v1 of a new testing package: `spatie/tabular-assertions`. It's a distillation of a testing method I've been using in client projects the past two years. The package supports both PHPUnit and Pest out of the box.

With tabular assertions, you describe the expected outcome in a markdown-like table format.

```php
expect($order->logs)->toLookLike("
    | type        | reason   | #product_id | #tax_id | #shipping_id | #payment_id | price | paid  | refunded |
    | product     | created  |       #1    |         |              |             | 80_00 | 80_00 |     0_00 |
    | tax         | created  |       #1    |      #1 |              |             |  5_00 |  5_00 |     0_00 |
    | tax         | created  |       #1    |      #2 |              |             | 10_00 | 10_00 |     0_00 |
    | shipping    | created  |       #1    |         |           #1 |             |  5_00 |  5_00 |     0_00 |
    | product     | paid     |       #1    |         |              |          #1 |  0_00 |  0_00 |     2_00 |
    | tax         | paid     |       #1    |      #1 |              |          #1 |  0_00 |  0_00 |     0_00 |
    | tax         | paid     |       #1    |      #2 |              |          #1 |  0_00 |  0_00 |     0_00 |
    | shipping    | paid     |       #1    |         |           #1 |          #1 |  0_00 |  0_00 |     0_00 |
");
```

Tabular assertions have two major benefits over other testing strategies: expectations are optimized for readability & failed assertions can display multiple errors at once.

## Write expectations that contain a lot of data and are optimized for readability

Text-based tables are compact, allow you to compare the data in two dimensions. The alternative would be to write multiple assertions.

```php
expect($items[0]['order_id'])->toBe($order->id);
expect($items[0]['name'])->toBeDate('Pen');
expect($items[0]['quantity'])->toBe(2);

expect($items[1]['order_id'])->toBe($order->id);
expect($items[1]['name'])->toBeDate('Paper');
expect($items[1]['quantity'])->toBe(1);

// …
```

Expectations require you to assert each property individually. This makes it hard to see all dates at a glance, and is less readable in general.

Associative arrays require a lot of repetition with labels.

```php
expect($items[0])->toBe([
    'order_id' => $order->id,
    'name' => 'Pen',
    'quantity' => 2,
]);

expect($items[1])->toBe([
    'order_id' => $order->id,
    'date' => 'Paper',
    'quantity' => 1,
]);

// …
```

Arrays without keys can't be aligned properly (manually maintained spaces would be striped by code style fixers). This becomes unclear when asserting multiple columns with different lengths.

```php
expect($items)->toBe([
    [$order->id, 'Pen', 2],
    [$order->id, 'Paper', 1],
    // …
]);
```

With tabular assertions, we get a compact, readable overview of the data, and because it's stored in a single string code style fixers won't reformat it.

```php
expect($items)->toMatchTable('
    | #id | #order_id | name   | quantity |
    |  #1 |        #1 | Pen    |        2 |
    |  #2 |        #1 | Paper  |        1 |
    |  #3 |        #1 | Pencil |        5 |
');
```

## Failures display multiple problems

With separate expectations, tests fail on the first failed assertion which means you don't have the full picture. (small issue vs. everything broken)

If you serialize two datasets to a table, you can get a nice output in a visual diff like PhpStorm's output when you use `assertEquals`.

In this assertions, you can see one value is wrong and one row is missing in one glance. With separate assertions, you only see the first error your test runner comes across.

## Placeholders

Sometimes you want to compare data without actually comparing the exact value. For example, you want to assert that each person is in the same team, but don't know the team ID because the data is randomly seeded on every run. A column can be marked as "dynamic" by prefixing its name with a `#`. Dynamic columns will replace values with placeholders. A placeholder is unique for the value in the column. So a team with ID `123` would always be rendered as `#1`, another team `456` with `#2` etc.

For example, Sebastian & Freek are in team Spatie which has a random ID, and Christoph is in team Laravel with another random ID.

```
| name      | #team_id |
| Sebastian |       #1 |
| Freek     |       #1 |
| Christoph |       #2 |
```

## Inspiration

I haven't come across this exact method anywhere else, so I had to come up with a name. If there's prior art that matches this with a better name, I'd love to know!

The idea was inspired by Jest, which allows you to use a [table as a data provider](https://maxoid.io/using-table-in-method-it.each-of-jest/).

[Snapshot testing](https://github.com/spatie/phpunit-snapshot-assertions) is also closely related to this. But snapshots aren't always optimized for readability, are stored in a separate file (not alongside the test), and are hard to write by hand (no TDD).

Tabular assertions have been a huge help when comparing large, ordered data sets like financial data or a time series. I hope you find it useful too!

Tabular assertions source & documentation is on [GitHub](https://github.com/spatie/tabular-assertions), and can be installed via composer.

```sh
composer require spatie/tabular-assertions
```
