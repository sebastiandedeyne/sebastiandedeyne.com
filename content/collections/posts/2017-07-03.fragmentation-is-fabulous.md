In a recent Twitter thread, [Sebastian McKenzie](https://twitter.com/sebmck) ([Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) author) shared his thoughts on the current state of open source. This tweet stood out for me (and he later ironically dubbed it his _"most thoughtleader tweet ever"_):

> Revel in fragmentation and duplication because without it there's stagnation and it stifles innovation.

When someone shares their latest pet project library, it's often met with responses like _"What a waste of time, you can already do this with library X!"_.

There's no need for justification here. Maybe the author wants something that fully matches their use case instead of the 80% that library X does, maybe they want a different internal architecture. Maybe they have bigger future plans in mind, or most importantly, maybe they just want to experiment, learn, and have fun.
