I enjoyed Mohamed's post on using PHP and Go to have the best of both worlds.

> By employing a polyglot architecture, we get the best of both worlds. PHP provides the development speed required to compete in a hyper-growth market, while Go provides more efficient resource utilization.

Another good quote from the introduction of his [PHP to Go](https://themsaid.com/courses/php-to-go) course:

> PHP may be slow and memory hungry when compared to a compiled language, but that's not a result of a bad design.
> 
> It's like this _by_ design because of all the choices it makes on your behalf to conceal complexity.

I also recommend his [post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/themsaid/status/1685920503725228032) about the business decisions behind cutting costs on infrastructure.
