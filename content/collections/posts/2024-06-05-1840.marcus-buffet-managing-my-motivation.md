Full title is [Managing My Motivation, as a Solo Dev](https://mbuffett.com/posts/maintaining-motivation/), but this is great advice for *any* dev.

My favorite:

> **Leave tasks unfinished**\
> I can’t overstate how much this one helps me. I try to leave a task 90% finished at the end of a working session. It feels slightly worse than closing out the work, but it makes starting the next day 10x easier. Having a quick win when I start coding is a massive boost, and it immediately gets me into the flow state. It can’t be too easy though, if all I have left is to run git commit, that’s not enough. Ideally it’s something where I know exactly what I need to do, that will take 5-10 minutes.

As I've written before: [end the day with a failing test](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/end-the-day-with-a-failing-test).
