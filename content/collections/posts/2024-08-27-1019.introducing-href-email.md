Next week we're sending out the first issue of a new newsletter: [href.email](https://href.email).

> Content on the internet is at a tipping point. Social media actively discourages sharing links, while AI-generated content is gaining prominence. We want to double down on human-created and curated content. Authors and creators put a lot of effort into their work, which we want to bring to the surface with our own touch.

I'm looking forward to help curate write these the coming months! (And I'm stoked about the domain name, how was that not taken?) Expect a healthy mix of dev/design/product content. Head over to [href.email](https://href.email) if you want to subscribe.
