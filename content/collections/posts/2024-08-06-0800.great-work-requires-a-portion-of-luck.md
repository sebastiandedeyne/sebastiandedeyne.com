I thought this image from Christoph Niemann in [Sunday Sketching](https://literal.club/book/sunday-sketching-j62li) was worth sharing.

We can force ourselves to do good work. But for great work, we need a portion of luck.

PS: I highly recommend Christoph's Abstract episode which you can watch for free on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_k8fVNzbGU).
