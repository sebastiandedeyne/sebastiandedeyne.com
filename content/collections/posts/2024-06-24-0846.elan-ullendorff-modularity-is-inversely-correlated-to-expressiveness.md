From [Escape the Algorithm](https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/should-this-be-a-map-or-500-maps). When we create a contract or a pattern, there are gains in familiarity, modularity, and composability, but it's a lossy translation.

> If I were to design a personal map of my neighborhood, it would include the potholes I swerve by on my bike rides, the neighborâ€™s sweet precocious 4 year old that is always on the front stoop and wants to tell me about her day, routes that have small patches of grass to the right of the sidewalk and end near a public trash can (suitable for walking my right-side-only peeing dog), the schedule and trajectory of shade during the summer, homes with potted flowers hanging off their railings, restaurants that closed ages ago, the playgrounds where we are most likely to run into parent friend crushes, and the street with the best view of the skyline at night.
