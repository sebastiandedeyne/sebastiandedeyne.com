Friendly reminder that you can disable Homebrew's default auto update behaviour with `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`.

{.short}
```sh
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install git-secret
```

If you want to set and forget the setting, add it to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

{.short}
```sh
export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```
