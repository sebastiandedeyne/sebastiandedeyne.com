When I'm working on a feature or refactor, I often leave `@todo` comments to remain in flow and deal with other points later.

I don't mind committing them to my feature branch, as long as I work them away before merging in.

On large branches, it can be easy to forget about that todo I left in there a few days ago.

```php
class PodcastController
{
    public function process(Podcast $podcast): void
    {
        $podcast->process();

        // @todo Broadcast event to trigger webhooks

        return $podcast;
    }
```

Before I merge, I pipe `git diff` into a `grep` call to scan for changes that include `@todo`.

```sh
git --no-pager diff main..feature-branch | grep -i "^\+[^$]*@todo"
```

```diff
+        // @todo Broadcast event to trigger webhooks
```

If you want to double check your changes before comitting, you can use the same command with `git diff HEAD`.

```sh
git --no-pager diff HEAD | grep -i "^\+[^$]*@todo"
```

## Pouring this in a bash function

Here's a quick bash function to scan for todos:

```sh
function todos() {
  git --no-pager diff ${1:"HEAD"} | grep -i "^\+[^$]*@todo"
}
```

Use it without an argument to look for todos you haven't committed yet, or pass the revisions you want to compare between.

```sh
# Look at current changes
todos

# Look for todos added between main and feature-branch
todos main..feature-branch
```
