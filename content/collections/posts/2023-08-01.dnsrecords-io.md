A few years ago we built a tiny web tool to view a site's DNS records. I still use it on a regular basis when I need to do a quick lookup.

Some cool tidbits:

- Visit [dnsrecords.io/{domain}](https://dnsrecords.io/spatie.be) to jump straight to the results (great for a Raycast/Alfred workflow!)
- Type `ip` or visit [dnsrecords.io/ip](https://dnsrecords.io/ip) to display your current IP address
- When you share a link to [dnsrecords.io/{domain}](https://dnsrecords.io/spatie.be), it will display the records in the meta & open graph descriptions
