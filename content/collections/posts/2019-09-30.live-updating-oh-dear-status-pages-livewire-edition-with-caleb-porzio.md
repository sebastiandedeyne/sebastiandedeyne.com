Last week I published [a post](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/live-updating-oh-dear-status-pages/) about how I implemented live updates on an Oh Dear! status page.

Caleb Porzio rebuilt the page with Livewire. It's pretty impressive to see how easy the process is by just adding a few built in Livewire directives.

Watch the short screencast [on Caleb's blog](https://calebporzio.com/live-updating-status-page-with-livewire/).
