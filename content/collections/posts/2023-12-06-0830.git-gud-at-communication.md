Another _blam_ on the Thunk blog:

> Product Managers, Agile, and other product development processes solve communication problems. If everyone had telepathic powers, those problems would shrink or disappear. The next best thing to telepathy is a team who excels at communication. If your team communicates to bridge these knowledge gaps, your need for PMs and Agile will shrink.
