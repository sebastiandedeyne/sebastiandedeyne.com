Google went down today. Downtime at this scale doesn't happen often, but when it rains, it pours. Google going down doesn't only affect Google products, it also affect products connected to Google.

Besides the "works without a connection" argument, local-first software completely removes a main performance bottleneck: latency. Zero latency is fast by default. This is noticable in apps built this way like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com). No latency. No loading spinners. All seamless.
