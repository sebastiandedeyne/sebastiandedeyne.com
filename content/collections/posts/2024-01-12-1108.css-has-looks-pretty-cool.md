I haven't really played around with the new [`:has` selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has) in CSS yet, but this example from Chris Coyier piqued my interest.

With this query, you can dynamically filter a list with pure CSS!

```css
body:has([name="filter"][value="bakery"]:checked)
  .card:not([data-category="bakery"]) {
  display: none;
}
```
