[The Cascade](https://csscade.com) is a great new blog on all things CSS by Robin Rendle. It's also an attempt to fill the void left by CSS-Tricks, for which Robin was also a writer for. And like CSS-Tricks, every time you visit the blog you might be surprised with a tweaked design.

CSS is in a really good place these days, but there's a lot to keep up with. [Max BÃ¶ck](https://mxb.dev/blog/old-dogs-new-css-tricks/) also just shared a great article on keeping up with recent features.
