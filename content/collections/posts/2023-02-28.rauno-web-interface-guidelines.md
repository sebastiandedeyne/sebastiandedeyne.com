Rauno Freiberg (designer at Vercel) shares his web guidelines for web interfaces. A few that stood out for me:

> - Inputs should be wrapped with a `<form>` to submit by pressing Enter
> - Interactive elements should disable `user-select` for inner content
> - Actions that are frequent and low in novelty should avoid extraneous animations

Read them all on Rauno's (beautiful) [website](https://rauno.me/interfaces), and check out the Craft section while you're there.
