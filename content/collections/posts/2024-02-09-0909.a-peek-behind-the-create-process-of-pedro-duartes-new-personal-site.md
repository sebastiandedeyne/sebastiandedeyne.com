I thouroughly enjoyed the walk through Pedro's design process for his personal website. From where he drew inspiration, to live snapshots of the design's iterations.

To repeat the words of [Chris Coyier](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-chris-coyer) again:

> Redesigning your personal website is one of lifeâ€™s great pleasures.
