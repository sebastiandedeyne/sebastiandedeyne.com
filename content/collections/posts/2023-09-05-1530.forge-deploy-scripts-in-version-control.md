I love Laravel Forge's quick deploy scripts. Forge allows you to set up a deploy script in their web interface and run it when you push to a git branch. However, I generally prefer to keep orchestration in the git repository. It's nice to have history, and I don't want to visit Forge whenever I want to make a change to the deploy script.

An elegant solution: move the script to a file. I created a `deploy.sh` and call it from Forge.

My deploy script isn't too bulky for now. It runs `composer install` and `npm ci` for dependencies, builds assets, clears the cache, caches config files, and does a safe restart of the php fpm process.

```sh
composer install --no-dev --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader

npm ci
npm run build

php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:cache

( flock -w 10 9 || exit 1
    echo 'Restarting FPM...'; sudo -S service php8.2-fpm reload ) 9>/tmp/fpmlock
```

Which I call from Forge:

```sh
cd /home/forge/full-stack-artisan.dev
git pull origin $FORGE_SITE_BRANCH

./deploy.sh
```

Don't forget to make `deploy.sh` executable before use.

```sh
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

Whenever I need to tweak the deploy script, I can update it from my text editor and `git push`.
