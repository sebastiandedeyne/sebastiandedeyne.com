I can't count the amount of times I've defined an object type with unknown string keys and a specific value type.

```js
type Scores = {
    [key: string]: number;
}
```
And despite using it all the time, I can't for the life of me remember the `[key: string]` syntax.

Today, my problems are solved. Apparently TypeScript has a built in `Record` type that does exactly that:

```js
type Scores = Record<string, number>;
```
