Last week I was setting up al old Laravel project that required MySQL 5.7. I installed [DBengin](https://dbngin.com) so I could have the legacy MySQL version up and running alongside the modern MySQL 8. Smooth sailing so far, until my Laravel app wanted to connect to the database.

```
SQLSTATE[HY000] [2054] The server requested authentication method unknown to the client
```

It took some googling to find a solution that worked. Most solutions recommended changing the authentication method in MySQL, but this was already configured correctly for me. What I had to do was explicitly configure a socket for MySQL to connect with. I added the following to my `.env` file:

```
DB_SOCKET=/tmp/mysql_3307.sock
```

Replace `3307` with the port number you configured your MySQL server to run on.
