It's been an odd few days with the changes on Reddit and Twitter â€“ the only two major social media platforms I browse.

Platforms are great portals for discovery, but a guarantee for longevity is not their strong suit. And while the fediverse is interesting, my Mastodon experience feels more like a detox than something that stands on its own.

As for good content, I get most of that from blogs anyway. And as long as the internet exists as we know it, we'll always have them.

Here's a selection of my favorite blogs and sites from my RSS reader.
