I came across this post by Jason Fried (from Basecamp) about giving ideas a few minutes before shooting them down.

I've caught myself blurting out unnecessary negative opinions when presented with an idea. More often than not, I have more empathy towards the idea a few minutes later, and feel bad about my initial reaction.

> Next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.
