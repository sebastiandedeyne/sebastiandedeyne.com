As I'm refactoring an existing design system, this article by [Elise Hein](https://twitter.com/elisehein) came quit timely.

We consider HTML to be cheap, but wrapping `div`s in `div`s in `div`s comes with a cost that slowly creeps up.

> 2. Redundant elements can create problems with accessibility
> 3. Redundant elements can break styling
> 4. Deeply nested dom trees are annoying to work with
