At Laracon US we announced we're working on a new course at Spatie: [Full Stack Artisan](https://full-stack-artisan.dev/).

In Full Stack Artisan, we'll dive into building Laravel applications with Inertia, React, TypeScript, view models, our Laravel Data package, and more.

Last week I took a break from working on course content to set up branding and a landing page.

## Just a website

For now, we needed a landing page with a Mailcoach subscription form. No PHP or static site generator, long live `index.html` & `site.css`!

{.short}
```
public/
└ img/
  └ …
└ favicon.ico
└ index.html
└ site.css
```

Our `index.html` is only 50 lines long, the majority being `meta` tags. Little HTML requires little CSS, so it wasn't worth introducing a build step to minify. All view-sourceable like it's 2008!

## Modern goodies

The header and background graphics are encoded in WEBP, a modern image format for the web. It's the first time I've actively used it, and oh my is it lean. The 180 KB background image shrunk down to 28 KB after converting from JPEG to WEBP using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app).

I used the new-ish `aspect-ratio` property in CSS to define the header's aspect ratio, so the layout doesn't shift when the image starts loading.

{.short}
```
.banner {
  aspect-ratio: 480 / 340;
}
```

I also had some fun with the CSS `:target` selector. Our subscription form redirects to `https://full-stack-artisan.dev/#subscribed` to display a flash message after a visitor subscribes.

{.short}
```
#subscribed {
  display: none;
}

#subscribed:target {
  display: block;
}
```

I wrote a more in-depth article about `:target` on the [Mailcoach blog](https://www.mailcoach.app/resources/blog/how-to-display-a-subscription-confirmation-message-with-css).

In the coming months, Freek, Ruben, and I will be experimenting, writing, and recording the course. I look forward to share more on the thought process soon.
