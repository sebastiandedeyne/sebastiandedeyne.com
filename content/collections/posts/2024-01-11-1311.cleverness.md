From [The Tao of Pooh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48757.The_Tao_of_Pooh):

> Remember when Kanga and Roo came to the Forest? Immediately, Rabbit decided that he didn't like them, because they were Different. Then he began thinking of a way to make them leave. Fortunately for everyone, the plan failed, as Clever Plans do, sooner or later. Cleverness, after all, has its limitations. Its mechanical judgments and clever remarks tend to prove inaccurate with passing time, because it doesn't look very deeply into things to begin with. The thing that makes someone _truly_ different — unique in fact — is something that Cleverness cannot really understand.

Think of this next time you write Clever Code.
