I'm in the process of cleaning up some npm packages that haven't been touched in a while, and part of that is pruning all the cruft that has been accumulated in `package.json` over the years.

I was looking for a canonical order to sort the keys by, and thought the order the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) specify the configuration options made sense.

Of course, after manually sorting one `package.json` file—which probably took 2 minutes—I decided to spend 30 minutes to find our how I could automate sorting the other two.

Luckily there's an npm package for everything. With the `sort-package-json` package you can go sort your `package.json`s in a logical order.

{.short}
```
npx sort-package-json **/*/package.json
```

That's all I had to do to keep my monorepo clean and tidy.
