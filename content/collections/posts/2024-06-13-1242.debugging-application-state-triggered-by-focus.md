In any modern browser's element inspector, you can force an element into a `:hover` or `:focus` state to debug styling issues. Sometimes, you want to debug an issue of an element in focus with a state controlled by JavaScript. Unfortunately, the forced states from the developer console aren't always enough.

![Toggling focus in devtools](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/assets/devtools-focus-state.gif)

I came across this problem when I was styling a custom `<select>` component in React. The dropdown menu is only visible when the input is focussed, but I couldn't inspect this state with the devtools. Whenever I wanted to browse the element tree, the devtools became the active element on the page and the menu disappeared.

Luckily, I came across a tiny snippet to help debug in this situation.

```js
window.setTimeout(() => { debugger; }, 5000);
```

This will wait five seconds until it halts all code execution with a debugger breakpoint. With this snippet, I load the page, set everything up into the state I want to inspect—5 seconds is more than enough time—and wait for the timeout to fire. When the debugger is triggered, I can browse and tinker with the element tree without worrying about the page updating.

In React, I wrapped this in a `useEffect` call to run once for the component I wanted to debug.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  window.setTimeout(() => { debugger; }, 5000);
}, []);
```
