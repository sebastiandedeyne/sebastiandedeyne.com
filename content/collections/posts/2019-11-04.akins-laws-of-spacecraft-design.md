Back in 2003 when I was still in elementary school, Dave Akins wrote a list of laws to abide when building a spacecraft. I'm not planning to build one of those any time soon, but there seem to be many similarities with web development. A few examples:

> - Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion
> - Design is based on requirements. There’s no justification for designing something one bit “better” than the requirements dictate
> - Don’t do nuthin’ dumb

Here's a good one te keep next to your desk, and consider yourself lucky next time you ship a bug to production.

> - Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the engineering, somebody dies
